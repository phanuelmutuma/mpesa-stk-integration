> A guide for integrating MPESA API using Node JS and PHP

This repository is meant to serve as an unofficial guide for how to set up the MPESA Daraja API for web and mobile apps. The official documentation can be found [`here`](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/). The aim of this guide is to provide a much clear path to follow through as the official documentation can be quite hefty.

## Install

These instructions are basic; you can use any language of choice but for the purpose of this guide we'll keep it to NodeJS. Clone the repo to get started

```sh
# Clone the repo.
git clone https://github.com/phanuelmutuma/mpesa-stk-integration

# cd into the folder, ensure you have node installed and run
npm install express morgan body-parser superagent nodemon
```

## Authentication

```sh
 const auth = 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(req.query.STK_APP_CONSUMER_KEY + ':' + req.query.STK_APP_CONSUMER_SECRET).toString('base64');
 const response = await superagent.get(url_credentials).set('Authorization', auth);
 const access_token = response.body.access_token;
```

## Request Sample

`Base64 Encoding` for our password field

```sh
 const password = req.query.STK_APP_SHORTCODE + passkey + timestamp;
 const password_hash = Buffer.from(password).toString('base64');
 const auth_header = 'Bearer ' + access_token;
```

Have a look into the code. We are using router dependency to (obviously) route requests to the API. Reason for using a custom API for this it to call it from any platform (Android, Web, iOS) and also easens the burden of managing urls. However you can choose to run the code directly as a path to a url and call a HTTP request from your development environment.


```sh
# A sample request.
 const headers = {
    'Authorization': auth_header,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Timestamp': timestamp,
    'X-Password': password_hash
  };
  const body = {
     "BusinessShortCode": req.query.STK_APP_SHORTCODE,
     "Password": password_hash,
     "Timestamp": timestamp,
     "TransactionType": "CustomerPayBillOnline",
     "Amount": "1",
     "PartyA": "254708374149",
     "PartyB": req.query.STK_APP_SHORTCODE,
     "PhoneNumber": "254708374149",
     "CallBackURL": "https://domain/callback",
     "AccountReference": "Test Account",
     "TransactionDesc": "Test Transaction"
 };
```

Feel free to check out the rest of the code.


### Simulating

You'll need [`Postman`](https://www.postman.com/) for this! Install it depending on your platform

```sh
# Start the server.
npm start
```

In Postman, ensure you set the environment variables first

![env_variable_postman](http://url/to/img.png)
 
As our host machine acts as the server we use `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/initialize` as the url and set it as a `GET` request

For now you dont' have to worry about `Authentication` as it is already defined in the code. When going live or in Production however, ensure you set authorization paramaters as environment variables
